<h1><u><center>What Is Software Engineering?</center></u></h1>
<p>Software engineering is a concept in and of itself, but to better understand it, you need to know what each part of the term means before you can fully understand how they operate together. It can be difficult to understand, even though it does seem straightforward. That is because the pieces are more complicated than many believe - and working with software engineering for an application is difficult and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Software engineering starts when there is a demand for a specific result or output for a company, from an application. From somewhere on the IT team, typically the CIO, there is a request put into the developer to create some sort of software. The software development team breaks down the project into the requirements and steps. Sometimes, this work will be farmed out to independent contractors, vendors, and freelancers. When this is the case, software engineering tools help to ensure that all of the work done is congruent and follows best practices.</p>
<p>How do developers know what to put into their software? They break it down into specific needs after conducting interviews, collecting information, looking into the existing application portfolio, and talking to IT leaders. Then, they will build a roadmap of how to build the software. This is one of the most important parts because much of the “work” is completed during this stage - which also means that any problems typically occur here as well.</p>
<p>The true starting point is when developers begin to write code for the software. This is the longest part of the process in many cases as the code needs to be congruent with current systems and the language used in them. Unfortunately, these problems often aren’t noticed until much later on in the project and then rework needs to be completed.</p>
<p>The code should be tested as it is written and once it has been completed – at all parts of the life cycle. With software engineering tools, you will be able to continuously test and monitor</p>
